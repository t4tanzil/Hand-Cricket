**# Hand-Cricket**

Description: The project is an electronic cricket game with a display and keypad, incorporating 
some unique modifications. The game begins by allowing the player to choose whether they want to 
bat or bowl. Once the choice is made, the match starts. 
 
**During the batting phase: **
 The player selects a number between 0 and 6 using the keypad. 
 The computer generates a random number within the same range. 
 If the numbers do not match, the player's selected number is added to their total score. 
 If the numbers match, the player is "out," and the batting phase ends. 
The game lasts for three overs. After the first player is out, roles are switched: the player who was 
bowling now bats, and the same rules apply. 

**The objective: **
 The batting player must achieve a higher score than the opponent's total. 
 If the batter scores more, they win; otherwise, the bowler wins. 
The display provides live updates on scores, while the keypad allows user input for selecting 
numbers. This interactive game combines strategy and chance, making it a fun and engaging 
experience!
